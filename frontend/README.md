# OIN¢: A MONEY TRACKING APP FOR KIDS

## Description
Kids can get a surprising amount of money: tooth fairy coins, gifts from the grandparents, pennies from the couch. And unlike most our financial transactions, it's almost all in cash. This can come in handy when we need cash to pay the babysitter, but it's a lot to keep track of. OIN¢ can help. OIN¢ is a simple tracking app that kids and their parents can use to keep track of the money coming in and out.

## Instructions for Use
Currently, functionality is limited due to lack of both back-end storage and security. Users can create an account and enter withdrawals and/or deposits, which are kept track of on the "Dashboard" page as well as on the corresponding component page.

## Roadmaps for Future Improvement
- Implement long-term user data storage
- Implement user authentication and account security
- Add additional transaction details, like a note
