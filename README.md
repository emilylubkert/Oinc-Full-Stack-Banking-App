# OIN¢: A MONEY TRACKING APP FOR KIDS
Try it [here](https://emily-lubkert-fullstackbankapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Kids can get a surprising amount of money: tooth fairy coins, gifts from the grandparents, pennies from the couch. And unlike most our financial transactions, it's almost all in cash. This can come in handy when we need cash to pay the babysitter, but it's a lot to keep track of. OIN¢ can help. OIN¢ is a simple tracking app that kids and their parents can use to keep track of the money coming in and out.

## Instructions for Use
Users can create an account and enter withdrawals and/or deposits, which are kept track of on the "Dashboard" page as well as on the corresponding component page. All data is stored in a backend database with MongoDB Atlas.

## Roadmaps for Future Improvement
- Add additional transaction details, like a note/description
- Add user profile component
- Add different types of accounts (e.g., guardian and child) with different capabilities (e.g., guardians can manage multiple child accounts)
